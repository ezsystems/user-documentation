# Site Factory

The Site Factory allows you to easily create and manage multiple sites in different languages from one place.
All the sites can be kept in one repository and have the same instance.
To be able to use it, the Site Factory has to be enabled and configured by your administrator.
For more information see developer documentation on [Site Factory]().

## Create a site
