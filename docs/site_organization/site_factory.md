# Site Factory

!!! enterprise

    The Site Factory enables you to easily create and manage multiple sites in different languages from one place.
    All the sites can be kept in the Repository of your installation.
    To be able to use it, the Site Factory has to be enabled and configured by your administrator.
    For more information see developer documentation on [Site Factory](https://doc.ezplatform.com/en/latest/guide/site_factory/).

    To access Site Factory select the **Site** tab and Site Factory icon.
    If Site Factory is enabled, and you have sufficient permissions, you should be able to click the **Create** button and access **Creating a new Site**.

    If the design defines a Site skeleton, you can choose if you want to copy the entire content structure of the design with a toggle.
    To preview the Site skeleton architecture go to **Admin** > **Site skeletons** tab.
