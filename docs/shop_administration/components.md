Text module is a special Content item in [[= product_name_com =]].
It enables the shop owner or editor to translate some of the text information in the shop by using the Online Editor.

Text modules are used for some short explanatory texts in the shop.
Every text module has a unique identifier.

This identifier must match exactly and cannot be changed even with text changes.
If a text module has not yet been translated, the identifier is displayed in the frontend.
