# Enabling Personalization

The Ibexa Personalization solution is based on a client-server architecture.
To make enable it, you must get and set up authentication parameters.

## Requesting access to the server

First, you must accept the terms and conditions of the Personalization service.

To do this, in the Back Office, select **Personalization** and then **Dashboard**.
On the welcome screen, enter the following details in their respective fields:

- Full name of the person responsible for accepting the terms and conditions
- Email address to which you want the confirmation to be sent
- Installation key that can be found on the **Maintenance and Support agreement details** page in the service portal

Select the **I have read and agree to the Terms and Conditions** checkbox, and then click **Submit**.
Your request is sent to Ibexa, and you will receive a confirmation email in response.

## Configuring mandator credentials

When you receive the confirmation email, ask your administrator to [add the credentials to your configuration](https://doc.ibexa.co/en/latest/guide/personalization/enabling_personalization).

## Changing the Installation key

If necessary, you can modify the installation key configured in the personalization settings.
To do this, in the Back Office, select **Personalization** and then **Settings**.
Modify the value in the **Installation key** field and save your changes.

!!! note "Disabling the service"

    Clearing the **Installation key** field disables the personalization solution for your account temporarily.
