# Configuring personalization

In the Back Office, from the top bar you can access a number of pages, where you can review 
the settings that control the personalization service.

If your [user role](../site_organization/organizing_the_site.md#permissions) includes 
the `Personalization/Edit` Policy, you can modify the settings according to your requirements.

To do this, navigate to one of the pages mentioned below and click the **Edit** icon next to 
a name of the item that you want to modify.

## Models

The **Models** page lists all available models and provides detailed information, 
such as the scenarios that use each model or when the model was last triggered.
Models come predefined with the software, based on the arrangements that your 
organization makes with Ibexa when defining the initial configuration.
You can request that a specific model is created by contacting customer support.

Here, you can click the **Edit** icon to access the model configuration screen and modify the settings, such as, for example:

- A timeframe in which the algorithm gathers events used in the calculation
- Submodels that can narrow down the list of model results
- A list of items included or excluded from the model 

For more information, see [Recommendation models](recommendation_models.md).

## Scenarios

The **Scenarios** page contains a list of all available scenarios.
It also provides additional information, such as a description of each of the scenarios, models 
that the scenario uses, or indication of whether the scenario is operational or not.
