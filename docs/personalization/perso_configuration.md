the `Personalization/Edit` Policy, you can modify the settings according to your requirements.
To do this, navigate to one of the pages mentioned below and edit the item that you want to modify.

## Models

The **Models** page lists all available models and provides detailed information, 
such as the scenarios that use each model or when the model was last triggered.
Models come predefined with the service, based on the arrangements that your 
organization makes with Ibexa when defining the initial configuration.
You can request that a specific model is created by contacting customer support.
