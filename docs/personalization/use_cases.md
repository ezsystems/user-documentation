# 2. Use Cases

There are many different use cases where recommendations can be used. The most common ones are located in the e-commerce and publishing industries.

## E-commerce

E-commerce recommendations can be very powerful to help customers find what they're looking for. If a user is not sure about what to buy, recommendations can be used to show similar, alternative or complementary products. Some typical use cases are:

- On the landing page the current bestsellers ('Hot Sellers') are shown to every customer.
- A detail page displays the products that were bought by others ('What other customers bought') or have been frequently bought together (e.g. this TV and a HDMI cable).
- The shopping cart page shows recommendations ('Related to your shopping cart') matching the products in the cart.
- On a category page, bestsellers of the current category are shown.
- Additionally on the landing page and on the detail page a recommendation bar could be placed to show **personalized recommendation** (based on their latest profile information) for the current user.

## Publishing

Recommendation and Personalization in the publishing business provide indirect value by keeping users on the website. Unlike in the e-commerce business, publishers often do not sell content, it is provided for free and cross-financed by advertisement. Increasing the CTR (click-through-rate) and adding value generated by advertisement is one of the drivers in the publishing business. Use cases for placing recommendations are straightforward:

- On the landing page, the most read content is presented.
- On every category page, the most popular content in the current category is shown.
- On every content page, the related content is shown.
