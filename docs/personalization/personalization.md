# 1. Personalization

A cloud based personalization service leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning 
technologies to deliver optimized customer experience. 
You can capture user preferences and interests to offer personalized content.

Before you can use the personalization service, you must enable it.
For more information about enabling personalization, see [the developer documentation](https://doc.ibexa.co/en/latest/guide/personalization/personalization/).

!!! note "E-Commerce vs. Publisher Wording"

    This guide's wording is more related to the E-Commerce Personalization Solution but can be used for 
    a thorough understanding of a Publisher Personalization Solution as well.

    Keep in mind that a product or item can be referred to as content and the buy event for non-paid 
    publisher content is replaced by the consume event.
