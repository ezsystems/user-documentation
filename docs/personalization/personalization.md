# Personalization

A cloud based personalization service leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning 
technologies to deliver optimized customer experience. 
You can capture user preferences and interests to offer personalized content.

Before you can use the personalization service, you must enable it.
For more information about enabling personalization, see [the developer documentation](https://doc.ibexa.co/en/latest/guide/personalization/personalization/).

!!! note "eCommerce vs. content publishing"

    This guide tends to mention personalization applications in eCommerce more often but provides 
    a thorough understanding of the publishing context as well.

    Both products or content items can be referred to as content and the buy event can be understood as
    the consume event.
