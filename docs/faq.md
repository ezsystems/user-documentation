# FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions about eZ Products

## General Questions

### Product

**What is the difference between eZ Platform and Enterprise Edition?**

eZ Platform is open-source. Enterprise Edition bases on eZ Platform and adds new functionalities.

**Which parts of eZ are open source and which are commercial?**

eZ Platform is fully open-source and available at [Github](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform).

eZ Enterprise is a commercial solution.

**What technologies do I need to know to use eZ?**

If you are using eZ as an editor or content manager, you do not need to have any programming knowledge.

Installing and configuring eZ will require at least basic familiarity of web development. Some more advanced customization possibilities may require programming skills (such as knowledge of PHP or Twig).

**What is Demo Bundle?**

Demo Bundle is a sample website you can get with your installation of eZ. There are two different Demo Bundles: one for eZ Platform and one for eZ Enterprise.

The Bundle contains a small number of initial preset Content Types. You can apply them directly in your website or use them as a starting point to create your own Content Types.

**What are the technical requirements for installing eZ?**

See [requirements](https://doc.ezplatform.com/en/latest/getting_started/requirements_and_system_configuration/) for the configuration required for installing eZ.

**How do I install eZ?**

See [installation](https://doc.ezplatform.com/en/latest/getting_started/install_ez_platform/) for a guide on how to install eZ products.

### Editing

**In what modes can I work with my content?**

eZ offers two different work modes: **Content mode** and **Page mode**.

**What is Content mode?**

Content mode gives access to the content repository. It is mostly the role of eZ Platform, but for users of eZ Enterprise it is enriched with specific Studio functionalities.

Its focus is creating, modifying, organizing and publishing Content items. Content mode is an interface for the repository, that is the place in which eZ stores all the content.

This mode lets you navigate the Content tree and edit any content present in it, as well as to move, copy and delete it. You can also create new content using the previously defined Content Types.

You can preview any Content within the tree, but the Content mode does not allow you to edit a Content item directly from this preview.

**What is Page mode?**

Page mode allows you to manage website pages and website content from the pages themselves. It is only available for eZ Enterprise users. It can be enriched by eZ Services functionalities for users subscribed to them.

It allows front-end editing, that is modifying pages directly from their preview. Using a special Timeline toolbar you can also preview and modify the content of a page at a future date.

The Page mode offers a special functionality of creating a Page - a special kind of Content with advanced customization options.

### Administration

**How do I grant and restrict access to my website?**

You can restrict access to your website per User or User group. Each User (or group) can be assigned Roles and Policies which define the operations they can perform on the website. You can assign them globally or only to parts of the website, by applying [Sections](organizing_the_content.md#sections).

See [Permissions](organizing_the_site.md#permissions) for more information.

**What are Policies?**

Policies are basic elements of the permissions system. They are rules defining access to one functionality of one module (for example modifying articles), with possible further limitations.

See [Permissions](organizing_the_site.md#permissions) for more information.

**What are Roles?**

Roles are an element of the permissions system. They are collections of Policies assigned to a particular user Role (for example a sports section editor).

See [Permissions](organizing_the_site.md#permissions) for more information.

**How do I assign Roles and Policies to a User?**

You can do it in the Admin Panel by selecting the Roles tab.

See [Permissions](organizing_the_site.md#permissions) for more information.

**What are Sections used for?**

Sections can be used to divide your content tree into separate parts. This is done for the purpose of limiting access to some of these parts for selected Users or User groups.

See [Sections](organizing_the_content.md#sections) for more information.

**How can I use Sections to control access to my website?**

You can divide your Content tree into sections in the Admin Panel, see [Sections](organizing_the_content.md#sections).

Then you can create Policies which concern only this Section.

**Can I have different language versions of one Content item?**

Yes, every Content item can have multiple language versions. See [Languages](creating_content_advanced.md#languages) for more information.

**What is a SiteAccess?**

It is a collection of configuration settings provided when accessing a website. A single site can have multiple SiteAccesses which define the content and design of the page that will be displayed. This functionality can be used for example to create separate versions of the website for visitors and for administrators, or for different language versions.

See [SiteAccess](https://doc.ezplatform.com/en/latest/guide/siteaccess/) for more technical information.

**How can I customize the look of my website?**

You can control the look of your website with great precision by creating and applying Twig templates. You can also create custom layouts for Pages.

See [Design](https://doc.ezplatform.com/en/latest/guide/design/) for more technical information.

## eZ Platform

### Product

**Where can I get eZ Platform?**

You can download the current version of eZ Platform from: <http://share.ez.no/downloads/downloads>.

**How do I install eZ Platform?**

Here is a [guide to installing eZ products](https://doc.ezplatform.com/en/latest/getting_started/install_ez_platform/) (covering both eZ Platform and eZ Enterprise).

### Content model

**What does eZ understand by "Content"?**

In the broad sense, content is everything that is placed on a site for the visitor to see.

In the narrow sense, a Content item is a single object used on a site. It can be, for example, an article, a photo gallery or a blog post. Technically, a Content item is an instance of a Content Type (that is, it is a single object created on the basis of a "blueprint" which is the Content Type).

**What are Content Types?**

Content Types can be treated as templates or blueprints for Content. They define Fields and their Field Types which are then assigned values when a Content item is created based on this Content Type.

Content Types are conceptually similar to classes in object-oriented programming.

**What Content Types do I have available?**

A small set of ready-to-use Content Types is provided with the Demo Bundle.

**Can I modify Content Types?**

Yes, you can adapt any Content Types provided in the Demo Bundle to your needs. See [Content Types](organizing_the_site.md#content-types) for more information.

**Can I make my own Content Types?**

Yes, you can freely create any new Content Types. See [Content Types](organizing_the_site.md#content-types) for more information.

**What are Field Types?**

Field Types define type of data which can be stored in a Field. Field Types which make up Content are defined in the Content Type.

Field Type is conceptually similar to a data type in programming. However, the available Field Types include both simple data types (for example integer or float numbers) and more complex structures (for example image, media file or binary file).

**Can I make my own Field Types?**

Yes, you can create custom Field Types. However, this is not available from the Admin Panel (like creating Content Types). Instead, they have to be created using PHP.

### Editing

**How do I create new content?**

You can create a new Content item in the Content mode by clicking **Create**. See [Creating content](creating_content_basic.md) for more information.

**What is the Location of a Content item and how is it determined?**

A Content item in itself does not have a place in the Content tree and is not visible for a visitor of the website. To take its place in the website it has to be assigned a Location ID.

A single Content item can have more than one Location ID, that is, it will be shown in more than one place in the Content tree. A single Location, however, can only have one Content item in it.

When you create a new Content item, it will automatically be given a Location ID and placed as a child of the Content item you were viewing when you clicked **Create**.

**How can I hide and unhide content?**

You can limit the visibility of a Content item by hiding the Location it is placed in. Hiding a Location also hides all other Locations that are under it in the content tree.

**How can I preview content?**

In Content mode you cannot edit Content while previewing it (this option is available only in Enterprise).

You can preview your content while editing it by clicking one of the icons under Preview in the action bar.

**What is the difference between saving and publishing content?**

The **Save** function allows you to save the current working copy into a draft to potentially reuse it later. The new version will not be published and then not visible on the site or through the API as published content

The **Publish** function allows you to publish the final version of the content object. As a result the working copy turns into a published version that is visible on the site and available through the API as a publish content.

## eZ Enterprise Edition

### Product

**Does eZ Enterprise contain all features of eZ Platform?**

**How do I install eZ Enterprise Edition?**

Here is a [guide to installing eZ products](https://doc.ezplatform.com/en/latest/getting_started/install_ez_platform/) (covering both eZ Platform and eZ Enterprise).

### Editing

**How does a Page differ from a regular Content item?**

A Page is a special kind of a Content item. It is a page designed to be the visitor's entry point into your website.

A Page has a customizable layout with multiple zones where you can place predefined blocks with dynamic content.

**How do I create a Page?**

You can create a new Page in the Page mode by clicking **Create**. See [Working with a Page](creating_content_basic.md#working-with-a-page) for more information.

**What blocks can I add to a Page?**

Here is the list of predefined Page blocks.

You also have the possibility of [creating your own, custom blocks](https://doc.ezplatform.com/en/latest/guide/extending_page.md#page-blocks).

**How can I have my Content reviewed by other users?**

You can use the Flex Workflow functionality to send your Content to review. You can access it from the Action bar in Content mode. See [Review workflow](publishing.md#review-workflow) for more information.
