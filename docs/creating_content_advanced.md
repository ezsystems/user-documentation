# Creating content, advanced

## Languages

The content on your website can be translated into different languages. Each Content item can have different language versions.
Which version is shown to a visitor depends on the way your installation is set up (see [SiteAccess](#siteaccess)).

### Adding translations

You can create a new translation of a Content item by going to the **Translations** tab and clicking the plus button.
You will see a list of all available languages. You can also base the new translation on an existing one.
All the Fields will then be pre-filled with the values they have in the base translation.
If you do not choose a base translation, the Fields will be empty. Every time you add or edit any translation,
the Content item gets a new version, the same way as when editing only one language.

You can only add translations in languages that have been set up for your website in the Admin Panel.
To create a new language for the website, go to the Admin Panel and the **Languages** tab and click the plus button.

Every new language must have a name and a language code, written in the xxx-XX format, for example eng-US, fre-FR, nor-NO, etc.
After adding a language you may have to reload the application to be able to use it.

!!! caution

    After adding a language you should be able to start adding translations to your content.
    However, depending on the way your website it set up, additional configuration will probably be necessary
    for the new language to work properly, especially with SiteAccesses.
    It's recommended you contact your administrator and inform them if you need to add a new language to the website
    (here is the [technical documentation of languages](https://doc.ezplatform.com/en/latest/guide/internationalization/)).

### SiteAccess

When working in Page mode you can see a bar at the top of the page listing SiteAccesses configured for your website.

SiteAccesses are a way of offering different versions of your website to different categories of users.
You can treat them as different "entrance points" to your website,
that allow you to show different content or design to the visitor, depending on which SiteAccess they use.

SiteAccesses can be used for example to serve a different website version for paying and non-paying visitors,
or different language versions to visitors from different countries.
You can use this bar to switch between and work on the different versions.

SiteAccess must be [set up by the administrator of the installation](https://doc.ezplatform.com/en/latest/guide/siteaccess/).

    ## Forms

    Forms enable you to place a survey, questionnaire, sign-up form, etc. on your site.

    Create a form like a regular Content item by choosing the Form Content Type.
    Click the edit button to start adding fields to the form.

    Build a form by dragging different types of fields into it.
    The available types are:

    - Single line input
    - Multiple line input
    - Number
    - Checkbox
    - Checkboxes
    - Radio
    - Dropdown
    - E-mail
    - Date
    - URL
    - File
    - Captcha
    - Button
    - Hidden field

    Each field has settings you can access through the options button.
    The settings differ depending on the type of the field.

    Button is a special kind of field. It is used for submitting the form.
    You can choose one of a few options of what is shown to the user after filling in and submitting the form.

    ### Viewing results

    Once you publish a form and users start filling it in, you can preview the results in the Submissions tab in Content item view.

    Here you can view the details of each submission.
    You can also delete any submissions (for example if they were made while testing or contain spam).

    The Download Submissions button enables you to download all the submissions in a CSV (comma-separated value) file.
